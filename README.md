# Depression posts detection

## Using machine learning methods, particularly Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB), to detect depression-related posts on social media. This could mean that machine learning can be an invaluable tool for digital mental health research and practical application.

Tested the algorithms on pre-labeled 7731 Reddit posts, I get:
- SVM correctly identifies 98% of non-depression posts and 92% of depression posts.
- NB correctly identifies 87% of non-depression posts and 96% of depression posts.

- **depression_clf.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook of the project. Showing statistics data about the dataset and results.
- **depression_clf.py**: Python code for the project.
- **depression_dataset_reddit_cleaned.csv**: The dataset
